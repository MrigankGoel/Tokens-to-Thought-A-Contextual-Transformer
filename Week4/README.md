## Week-4 Assignments

In weeks 4, we will try to implement a Transformer capable of generating text in Shakespearean prose. For insight into how transformers give meaning to the symbols we write in prose, this series of videos by 3B1B is great (https://youtu.be/wjZofJX0v4M?si=JuwbKSezBdLh1lWq, https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?si=6Zb_qi7ptmOrJnft).
